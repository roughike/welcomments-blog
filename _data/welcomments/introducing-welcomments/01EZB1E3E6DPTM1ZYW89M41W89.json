Whenever there's a new change in the GitHub repository, Netlify runs a new Jekyll build that crunches all the articles and comments into beautiful static HTML.\n\nDon't believe me? See the [JSON file](https://github.com/roughike/welcomments-blog/tree/master/_data/welcomments/introducing-welcomments/01EZB1E3E6DPTM1ZYW89M41W89.json) for this very comment."
