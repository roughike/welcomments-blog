I can always migrate your existing comments :-)\n\nI created [an RSS feed](https://blog.welcomments.io/feed.xml) for you if you want to stay updated. Alternatively, I can reach out to you again when Welcomments goes into public beta and is more feature complete.\n\nThanks for the valuable feedback and have an amazing day!",
