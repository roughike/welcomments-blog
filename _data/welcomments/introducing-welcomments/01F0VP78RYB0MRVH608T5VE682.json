Whenever there’s a new change in the GitHub repository, Netlify runs a new Jekyll build that crunches all the articles and comments into beautiful static HTML.\n\nDon’t believe me? [See the JSON file for this very comment](https://github.com/roughike/welcomments-blog/tree/master/_data/welcomments/introducing-welcomments).\n\nFeel free to test this it out yourself by commenting below :-)"
