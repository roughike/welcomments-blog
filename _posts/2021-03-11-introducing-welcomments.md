title: Introducing Welcomments
---

Hey there! I'm Iiro, and I'm building Welcomments, a new comment system for static sites.

<!-- more -->

Initially, I built Welcomments for [my personal Jekyll blog](https://iiro.dev).
I was using Disqus but grew frustrated with its bloat, ads, and tracking.
I built Welcomments in a few months, and I've been using it on my blog for a year now.

I met someone in a bar recently that needed static comments for his Jekyll site and was willing to pay for it.
I made it super easy for him to integrate Welcomments to his site.

As a consequence, there's now [a fancy admin panel](https://console.welcomments.io) with some bells and whistles that anyone can use to add static comments to their website.

I'm making Welcomments into a polished product so that everyone with a JAMStack site can have a nice
commenting experience without the bloat.
